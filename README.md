## Overview <a id="overview"></a>
A minimal app that uses the Rick and Morty Api to navigate through the different characters, images, and species of the TV show. It allows you to search for the characters through a series of different filters. 

## Build With <a id="buildwith"></a>

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation//)

### Additional Inputs

- **Redux** for state management, mainly because, it makes easier handling complex logic, manage app state in a single place, keep the state minimal, derive and memoize additional values whenever possible, and persist data on local storage.
- **Vite** is a fatser tool and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It has a dev server that provides feature enhanecement and a build command to bundle the code and highly optimizes it.
- **Rick and Morty API** open source project creted and based on the television show and available for all the people whether they enjoy the show or not.
